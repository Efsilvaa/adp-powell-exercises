# 3. Introduction to Markov Decision Processes (MDP)
------------------------------------------------

This folder contains the scripts that implements the algorithms/pseudo-code presented in chapter 3 and solution of some exercises. 

## Content

### Exercises

+ `03-exercise.py` implements a Markov reward process (no decisions) and see the evolution of the value function using a value iteration algorithm.
+ `05-exercise.py` same as `03-exercise.py` but implements an policy iteration algorithm approach.
+ `10-exercise.py` solves the problem of finding the best policy to park in a road (Finite horizon problem) using a state variable with two dimmensions plus the epoch. 
+ `11-exercise.py` solves an MDP with infinite horizon using value iteration, policy iteration and value-policy iteration algorithms.
